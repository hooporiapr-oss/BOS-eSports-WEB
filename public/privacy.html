        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your gamertag (username), email address, and password. Your password is securely hashed using industry-standard encryption (bcrypt) and is never stored in plain text.</p>

        <p><strong>Cookies and Session Data:</strong> We use session cookies to keep you logged in and to maintain your authenticated session. These cookies are essential for the functionality of the Service.</p>

        <p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating the Service (e.g., hosting providers), subject to confidentiality obligations.</p>
        <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Your password is hashed using bcrypt encryption. Session data is managed through secure server-side sessions.</p>
